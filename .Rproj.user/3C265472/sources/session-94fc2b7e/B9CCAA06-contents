## **Research question**  
- **Central question**:  
  - **How do personal life trajectories and critical events influence individuals’ migration intentions to Switzerland over time?** 
- **Key focus**:  
  - Migration intention over time
  - Life course perspective
- **Methods (mixed)**:
  - Quantitative: Longitudinal multilevel analysis
  - Qualitative: Depend on the trajectories selected

## Migration intention {auto-animate="true"}
**2 years after:**

  - 70% indeed emigrated (Wanner, 2021)
  
  - 24% - 36% indeed emigrated (Van Dalen & Henkens, 2008)
  
**Factors** (Bernard & Vidal, 2023; Kulu & Milewski, 2007): 

  - Job opportunities
  
  - Birth
  
  - Social network
  
  - ...

## **Research context** {auto-animate="true"}
- **Demographic scope** (Findlay et al., 2015):  
  - Age groups, gender, family statuses, migrant groups, ...
- **Life course** (Horowitz & Entwisle, 2021).:
  - **Life events** (e.g., education, job loss, birth, divorce)  
  - **Linked lives** (family/social networks influencing decisions)  
  - **Historical time/place** (contextual factors like economic crisis).
  - **Individual agency** (decision-making processes)  
  - **Timing of lives** (age-related migration patterns)

## **Research context** {auto-animate="true"}
- **Traditional methods are limited**
  - **Quantitatives studies**:
    - Despite the longitudinal approach
    - Focus on few specific life event.
  - **Qualitative studies**: 
    - Despite the richness of the analysis
    - Usage of small samples
  - **Social media data** (Sîrbu et al., 2021)
    - Big Data
    - Textual data + Metadata
  
## **Methodological innovation**  
- **Why this study is unique**:  
  - **Longitudinal Data**: Tracks individuals’ journeys over **4 years** (2 years before/after relocation decisions).  
  - **Mixed Methods**: Combines large language models (for data extraction) with longitudinal multilevel (for interpretive insights). 
    - **Today: Quantitative part**
  - **Use of Reddit**: Captures **nuanced, unfiltered narratives** from users who express relocation intentions.
  
## **Reddit**
### https://backlinko.com/reddit-users
**What?**

- Social media

- Founded in 2005

- Community based


**Statistics**

- 97.2 million daily active users

- +100'000 active subreddits

![](Reddit-Logo.jpg){.absolute right=0 top=0 height=150}
![](subreddit.png){.absolute right=0 top=200 height=400}
  
## **Adavantages of Reddit**
- **Longitudinal Tracking**:  
  - Enables analysis of how **personal circumstances, policies, and crises** (e.g., pandemic) dynamically shape migration decisions.  

- **Ethical and accessibility benefits**:  
  - Reddit’s **anonymity** and **accessible API** reduce ethical concerns compared to traditional methods (e.g., surveys).  

- **Novel use of non-official APIs (Application Programming Interface)**:  
  - The **PullPush API** facilitates comprehensive data collection over extended periods, a rarity in migration studies.

## **Key objectives**  
- **Primary goal**:  
  - Map the **temporal progression** of migration intention using data from Reddit’s *r/AskSwitzerland*.  
  - Highlight the **impact of Covid-19** in migration intention
- **Side objectives**:  
  - Show that **Reddit data** are valuable
  - Show that **SLMs (Small Language Models)** are valuable tools for data extraction
  - Show that **the Julia programming language** is a valuable programming language for social scientist

# Method

## **Data Source: Reddit and r/AskSwitzerland**  

![](askswitzerland.png)

## **Data Source: Reddit and r/AskSwitzerland**  
- **Platform Choice**:  
  - Reddit is used as a primary source due to its **rich textual data** and **community-driven discussions** about migration.  
  - The subreddit **r/AskSwitzerland** is specifically targeted, as it is a hub for users seeking information about living in Switzerland and expressing relocation intentions.  

- **Non-Official API (PullPush)**:  
  - Utilizes the **PullPush API** to collect longitudinal data, enabling **long-term tracking** of user behavior and migration intentions.

## **The full workflow**

![](full_process.png)

---

## **Data collection**  
- **Three-stage approach**:  
  1. **Initial collection (2018–2020)**:  
     - Posts containing keywords like *“Relocation,” “Migration,” “Mobility,”* or *“Living in Switzerland”* are gathered.  
  2. **Filtering**:  
     - Posts are filtered to retain only those expressing **genuine intent to move to Switzerland**.  
  3. **Saving user name**:  
     - A list of user name is saved in a database.

## **Data extraction**

- **Three-stage approach**:
  1. **User's comment history (2nd data collection)**:
    - Collecting user's comment history 2 years before and after the migration intention
  2. **Monthly comment aggregation**:
    - The time unit is monthly so the comment are join this way
  3. **SLMs data extraction**:
    - Using a small language model specific information will be extracted

::: {.columns}

"Hey everyone,
I **(f28)** and my **husband (h28)** been dreaming of moving to Switzerland because I've received an exciting **job offer** from a tech company based there. The role involves developing innovative software solutions and working with a talented team, which aligns perfectly with my career goals."

Extract the following information of the poster 
in a JSON format: poster age, poster sex, 
migration reason [job, family], coming from, 
marital status, social network.

## **Data extraction** {auto-animate="true"}

**LLMs vs SLMs**

- **LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, ...)**
  - Efficient
  - Cost
  - Not confidential

- **SLMs (Llama, Qwen, ...)**
  - Less efficient
  - Free
  - Local (confidential)
  
![](qwen.png){.absolute right=100 top=0}

## **Analytical Methods**  {auto-animate="true"}
- **Quantitative Longitudinal Analysis**:  
  - Tracks **migration intentions over time** by aggregating data monthly and identifying key events (e.g., the **COVID-19 pandemic**) that influence decisions.  

- **Qualitative Insights**:  
  - **Large language models (Qwen 2.5 32b)** are used to extract factors influencing migration decisions from textual data.

## **Analytical Methods**  {auto-animate="true"}
**Data**

- **Dependent variables**: **Migration intention to Switzerland** (or elsewhere)
- **Life course**:
  - **Life events** (birth, death, job gain/loss, ...)
  - **Linked lives** (friends, family member mention)  
  - **Historical time/place** (Covid-19, economic shifts)

- **Sociodemographic**: (age, gender, occupation, country of origin)

## **Limits**

**Risky approach**

- **Non representative data** (mostly people from United State)
- **Sparse data** (Missing value, unstructured data)
- **Hard to track mobility intention**
- **LLMs/SLMs do not have 100% accuracy**
- **LLMs/SLMs are costly in terms of computation and time**
- **How to define life-course events**?
